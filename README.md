## Description

This project is designed to be a long term porftolio to display my work within the GA Tech Coding Boot Camp. As the Boot Camp continues, the page is intended to recieve updates as more projects are completed. The project was helpful to show the ease and necessity of Flex.

## Usage

Both the website itself and the linked GitHub repositories are intended to be an example of my work and habits.
